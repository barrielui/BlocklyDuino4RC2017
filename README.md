### BlocklyDuino for Robotic Challenge 2017

This project was forked from BlocklyDuino, a blockly programming editer for [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), to comply with the event [Robotic Challenge 2017](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/event/rcj2017/) organised by the Electronics and Information Engineering Department, Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Comparing with a standard Aurduino system, the robot for the event needed to control more servo motors (a total of 9) and a bluetooth module.  An servo controlling module by [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) was incorporated to the system.  There were modifications on the original BlocklyDuino to add bluetooth and Adafruit blocks.
